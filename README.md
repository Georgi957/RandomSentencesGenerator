## Code Explanation

The randomSentenceGenerator function generates a random sentence using predefined arrays of names, places, verbs, nouns, adverbs, and details. It uses the readline module to prompt the user to generate a new sentence by pressing Enter.

The getRandomWord function selects a random word from an input array.
Random words are selected from each array to create a sentence.
The first sentence is displayed along with a prompt.
When the user presses Enter, a new sentence is generated by selecting random words again and displayed.
The process repeats until the program is manually terminated.
